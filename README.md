- Make my page presentable and appealing

```

## MY EFFORST TO REACH MY GOALS:
```
Layout:
- I spaced out all ellements on the page
- Used headers to define page sections
- Used boarders and backgrounds to show
  the separation in each category

Interactiveness:
- Used CSS to add interaction to my page
- Navbar has hover element to show that
  each item is clickable
- "Contact" uses hover to drop my
  contact information for the user
- Images under "my.WORK" grow as one hovers

Clean Code & Comments:
- All areas of code contain comments to
  demonstrate clearity for others
```
