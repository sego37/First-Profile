Layout:

- Used headers to define page sections
- Used boarders and backgrounds to show
  the separation in each category

Interactiveness:
- Used CSS to add interaction to my page
- Navbar has hover element to show that
  each item is clickable
- "Contact" uses hover to drop my
  contact information for the user
- Images under "my.WORK" grow as one hovers

Clean Code & Comments:
- All areas of code contain comments to
  demonstrate clearity for others
